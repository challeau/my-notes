# Rust basics

Rust is a **general-purpose programming language** emphasizing **performance**, **type safety**, and **concurrency**.

It **enforces memory safety**, meaning that all references point to valid memory. It does so **without a traditional garbage collector**; instead, memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the "borrow checker", which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time.

**High-level ergonomics** and **low-level control** are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to **control low-level details** without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.
