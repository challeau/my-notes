# TRANSITIONS

> A transition occurs when a CSS property changes from one value to another value over a period of time. 

It is possible to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change takes place: hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.<br>
The transition properties allow us to define the time it should take to go from one state to the other. It requires 2 numerical values (one to begin, one to end): 2 different heights, transforms with different values etc.

| property                   | specifies...                                        |

| transition-duration        | the duration of the transition                      |
| transition-timing-function | the timing function of the transition               |
