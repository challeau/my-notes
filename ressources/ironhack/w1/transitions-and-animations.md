# TRANSITIONS

> A transition occurs when a CSS property changes from one value to another value over a period of time. 

It is possible to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change takes place: hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.<br>
The transition properties allow us to define the time it should take to go from one state to the other. It requires 2 numerical values: one to begin, one to end (2 different heights, transforms with different values etc).

| property                   | specifies...                                        |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| transition-property        | the CSS property (or properties) to be transitioned |
| transition-duration        | the duration of the transition                      |
| transition-timing-function | the timing function of the transition               |
| transition-delay           | an optional delay                                   |
| transition                 | (shorthand)                                         |
