# Next.js


Next.js is a **React framework** for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional **features and optimizations**.

Under the hood, Next.js also **abstracts and automatically configures tooling** needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

Some of the main Next.js features include:
| Feature       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Routing       | A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.                                                    |
| Rendering     | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes. |
| Data Fetching | Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.                                                |
| Styling       | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS                                                                                                   |
| Optimizations | Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.                                                                                        |
| TypeScript    | Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.                                                 |
