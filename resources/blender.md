## 1 - Keymap

## 2 - Interface

Blender's interface is separated into three main parts:
 - The **Topbar** (blue) at the very top consists of the main menu, which is used for saving, importing and exporting files, configuring settings, and rendering among other functions.
 - **Areas** (pink) in the middle, which is the main workspace
 - The **Status Bar** (yellow) at the bottom, which displays shortcut suggestions and relevant statistics.

The Areas are customizable. Right-click on an Area's header to see the layout options: 
 - *Close area* to remove an area.
 - *Vertical/Horizontal split* + click to split the area into 2. Use `tab` to switch between horizontal and vertical.
